# Positional Audio

</DocsDemo>

The `cientos` package provides an abstraction of the [PositionalAudio](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=posi#api/en/audio/PositionalAudio), `<PositionalAudio>` is an object specifically designed for controlling sound in a scene graph space. This allows for the simulation of various audio environments, creating a more immersive user experience.

`<PositionalAudio>` includes a helper üõ†Ô∏è that allows you to view the directional cone of te audio. The helper is based on the [PositionalAudioHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/helpers/PositionalAudioHelper) class.

::: info
This component is still under development, so please report any problems or suggestions on the [@tresjs/cientos](https://github.com/Tresjs/cientos) repository on GitHub.

## Usage

The `<PositionalAudio>` component is very simple to set up and use. It lets you bring 3D scenes to life. Without setting any parameters for the props at your disposal, all you have to do is call the `<PositionalAudio>` component surrounded by the `<Suspense>` component to allow it to load the audio you've provided. Only the `url` prop is required for this abstraction to work.

## Props

| Prop              | Description                                          | Default                   |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **url**        | `string` ‚Äî **required** ‚Äî The path or URL to the file. |                    |
| **helper**        | `boolean` ‚Äî Selects whether helper mode is enabled. <br> *(Useful for visualising the angle of sound propagation)*  | `false`                   |
| **distance**        | `number` ‚Äî The distance at which the volume reduction starts taking effect. ***A non-negative number.***  | `1`                   |
| **ready**        | `boolean` ‚Äî Tells `<PositionalAudio>` that `AudioContext` is authorised because an user gesture has been made on the page. This is imperative, as `autoplay` cannot be activated if no user gesture has been made previously (https://goo.gl/7K7WLu). <br> If you're sure that there will be a user gesture before your `<PositionAudio>` component appears, you can directly add `:ready="true"` and `autoplay="true"` for a direct launch.  | `false`                   |
| **autoplay**        | `boolean` ‚Äî Selects whether the audio is launched automatically. Please refer to the `ready` prop for a better understanding of how to use autoplay.  | `false`                   |
| **loop**        | `boolean` ‚Äî Specifies whether the audio should loop. |      `false`              |
| **innerAngle**        | `number` ‚Äî  Value describing the angle, in degrees, of a cone inside of which there will be no volume reduction. |      `360`              |
| **outerAngle**        | `number` ‚Äî  Value describing the angle, in degrees, of a cone outside of which the volume will be reduced by a constant value, defined by the `outerGain` prop. |      `0`              |
| **outerGain**        | `number` ‚Äî  Value describing the amount of volume reduction outside the cone defined by the `outerAngle` prop. When the value is `0`, meaning that no sound can be heard. |      `0`              |
