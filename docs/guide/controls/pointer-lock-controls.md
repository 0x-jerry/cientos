# PointerLockControls

[PointerLockControls](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=pointe#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls) is a camera controller that allows you to capture the mouse movement and simulate a first person camera. It is a perfect choice for first person 3D games.

However, as it is not part of the core of ThreeJS, to use it you would need to import it from the `three/examples/jsm/controls/PointerLockControls` module.

Here is where the fancy part begins. âœ¨
The `cientos` package provides a component called `<PointerLockControls />`, which is a wrapper of the `PointerLockControls` from the [`three-stdlib`](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) module.

The nicest part? You don't need to extend the catalog or pass any arguments.  
It just works. ðŸ’¯

::: warning
This control uses the [Pointer Lock API] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API), the same rules are applied, for example, you need to interact with the browser to "lock" or start the event.
In addition, you need to wait 1 second between canceling and re-starting the event
